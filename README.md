The goal for this project is to make a DokuWiki plugin that will pull a set of
GitHub issues from their API and format them nicely for display on a DokuWiki
page.

This will hopefully make it nice/easy to have actively updated buglists,
documentation requests, feature request, programmer warnings, etc. on the
wiki.
